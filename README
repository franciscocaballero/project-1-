When trying to figure out how to tackle this problem I didn't know where to start. I hit serval walls, and even questioned if becoming
a developer was for me.  I spent serval hours just staring at my computer screen not knowing why my project was functioning properly and
starting  over serval times. Javascript was the main reason for starting over so many times. After looking up a new Javascript structure
on codepen and tons of help from friends I finally was get my project working.
